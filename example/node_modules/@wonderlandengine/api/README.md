# Wonderland Engine API

The bindings between Wonderland Engine's WebAssembly runtime and custom JavaScript
or TypeScript components.

Learn more about Wonderland Engine at [https://wonderlandengine.com](https://wonderlandengine.com).

## Usage

Wonderland Engine projects usually come with this package pre-installed.
Install via `npm` or `yarn`:

```sh
npm i --save @wonderlandengine/api
# or:
yarn add @wonderlandengine/api
```

To update the API to the latest version use
```
npm i --save @wonderlandengine/api@latest
```

### Writing a Custom Component

Refer to the [JavaScript Quick Start Guide](https://wonderlandengine/getting-started/quick-start-js).

### For Library Maintainers

To ensure the user of your library can use a range of API versions with your library,
use `"peerDepenedencies"` in your `package.json`:

```json
"peerDependencies": {
    "@wonderlandengine/api": ">= 1.0.0 < 2"
},
```

Which signals that your package works with any API version `>= 1.0.0` (choose whichever
version has all the features you need) until `2.0.0`.

## Building

Make sure to install dependencies first:
```sh
npm i
```

To build the TypeScript, use one of:
```sh
npm run build
npm run build:watch
```

To run the tests, use one of:
```sh
npm run test
npm run test:watch
```

## API <> Runtime Versioning

The Wonderland Engine Runtime is compatible on all patch versions of the API, but the
major and minor versions are required to match. Example: you will be able to use
Wonderland Editor 1.0.4 with API version 1.0.0 or 1.0.9 for example, but probably not
with API 1.1.0.
